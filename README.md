# digispark_ir_ws2811
This code allows for WS2811 LEDs and an IR Receiver to be used at the same time on the Digispark (attiny85).

You will see visible flicking when IR signals come in, but it will only happen for a moment.

EEPROM saving can be enabled if desired.

Use the Arduino 1.6.5 IDE, newer versions don't seem to work with the Digispark software.
